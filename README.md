# Whole_Brain

This github contains the code for the testing of Chen and Campbell's Whole Brain model.

Original article for the population model: Chen, L., Campbell, S.A. Exact mean-field models for spiking neural networks with
adaptation. J Comput Neurosci 50, 445–469 (2022). https://doi.org/10.1007/s10827-022-00825-9

Generalized to Whole Brain by Adrià Puig.

The WholeBrain folder is extracted on It's entirety from my tutor's github, except for
Chen and Campbell Whole Brain version file in folder Models that is made by me.

The documents Chen_Campbell_setup, Prepro_fgain_CC.py, fitting_fgain_CC.py and fig_CC.py are also made by me.

To run this code you must go to fig_CC.py which is the main one from where the plotting of the Whole Brain fitting for
both values we and J can be accesed. To plot with value we call prepro file and fittinf_fgain if you want with J value.
The place where this can be configured is at the start and easy to see.

A detailed explanation of each code is at the start of every file so any extra doubts refer to the code.
